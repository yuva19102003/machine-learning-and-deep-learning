# Linear Regression with Multiple Variables (Multivariate Linear Regression)

## Overview

Linear regression with multiple variables, also known as multivariate linear regression, is an extension of simple linear regression. While simple linear regression models the relationship between a single dependent variable (target) and a single independent variable (predictor), multivariate linear regression models the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables.

## Mathematical Representation

The model can be represented by the equation:

\[ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \cdots + \beta_n x_n + \epsilon \]

where:
- \( y \) is the dependent variable.
- \( \beta_0 \) is the y-intercept (the value of \( y \) when all \( x_i \) are zero).
- \( \beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots, \beta_n \) are the coefficients (weights) for each independent variable.
- \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) are the independent variables.
- \( \epsilon \) is the error term (residuals) representing the difference between the actual and predicted values.

## Key Concepts

### Multiple Predictors
In multivariate linear regression, there are two or more predictor variables (independent variables) that influence the target variable (dependent variable).

### Coefficients
Each independent variable has an associated coefficient that represents its contribution to the prediction of the dependent variable. The coefficients are estimated during the training process.

### Assumptions
- **Linearity:** The relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables is linear.
- **Independence:** The observations are independent of each other.
- **Homoscedasticity:** The variance of the residuals is constant across all levels of the independent variables.
- **Normality:** The residuals (errors) are normally distributed.

### Model Fitting
The goal of multivariate linear regression is to find the best-fitting line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) that minimizes the sum of the squared differences (residuals) between the observed and predicted values of the dependent variable.

### Evaluation Metrics
Common metrics to evaluate the performance of a multivariate linear regression model include R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
